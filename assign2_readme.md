# Task 1: To check if a number is even or odd:
number is a variable which stores the input from the user. int a function which converts input string to an integer.
if the remainder upon division of a number by 2 equals zero, then that number is even.
Otherwise, its odd. 
For calculating the remainder, % is used.
The result whether the number is even or odd, is displayed using print function.

# Task 2: To find the sum of integers from 1 to 50: 
I initialize a variable value = 0
I then use for loop from 1 to 51, i.e. the variable i will take value from 1 to 50
For each iteration, value += i, means that i will be added to value and hence the value of variable value gets updated.
The final result is then printed.
